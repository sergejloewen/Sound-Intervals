# Sound Intervals

Sound Intervals is an app to create different custom intervals that have audio cues to let the user know when they start
and have them play in succession and also potentially loop.
It will have a library of different sounds to choose from and there will be a general timer of the overall time spent.  
The app will be built with react native, expo and javascript/typescript
and will be mainly for android, but due to the nature of the used technologies it is cross platform
and technically should also be able to run on the web and ios.  
Potential use cases are pomodoro techniques/ timers, time based training and more.  
Testing will be mainly done for android and potentially web too.
